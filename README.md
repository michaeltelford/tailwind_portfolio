# Tailwind Portfolio

A NextJS, React and Tailwind CSS app where I keep a portfolio of pages styled using Tailwind.

Most of the pages/components are duplicates of real life websites that I liked the look of. I replicated them using Tailwind to gain experience of building from a "mock up".

The goal isn't to exactly duplicate a webpage, but rather to build a professional mobile first UI with an inviting UX; all without writing any CSS.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies with:

    $ npm i

Run the development server with:

    $ npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

Then click on a link to see the page styled like the original using Tailwind.

## Credits

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I don't own any of the images or content. It's all public facing and I'm not using it for commercial means.
